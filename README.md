# Technical Analysis Quotex Candlestick Pattern

Candle shadows (also known as wicks or tails) show the price range
beyond the opening and closing price on a candlestick chart. During the
given period, they indicate the highest and lowest points. A higher
shadow indicates a high price, while a lower shadow indicates a low
price.

## Types of Candle Shadows

-   **Upper Shadows:** Upper shadows represent the high price point of
    the session, while lower shadows indicate how strong buyers were at
    the time.
-   **Lower Shadows:** Lower shadows show the seller\'s strength during
    a session and the low point of the session.
-   **Long Upper and Lower Shadows:** Spinning top candles have long
    upper and lower shadows indicating market indecision.
-   **Wide Range Candles:** Candles with wide ranges between their highs
    and lows indicate high volatility and high trading activity.
-   **Green and Red Candles:** Green candles indicate that the closing
    price was higher than the opening price, while red candles indicate
    that the closing price was less than the opening price.
-   **Bullish Engulfing Patterns:** Bullish engulfing patterns are major
    reversal signals for the bulls.

## Technical Analysis of Candle Shadow Trading Strategies

Technical analysis is a trading discipline that uses various charting
tools, indicators, and patterns to predict the price movement of future
securities. Candlestick charts and candle shadow analysis within them
are key elements of technical analysis.

Candle shadow trading strategies often involve looking for long shadows
that cross or touch trend lines, resistances, or supports. The longer
the upper shadow, the more likely it is that the price will reverse to
the downside if it breaks through resistance levels. Long lower shadows
can also touch support levels, signaling that a bearish reversal is
likely when the level has held.

Another strategy involves identifying long shadows on overbought or
oversold stocks. An asset in overbought conditions might show a long
upper shadow, signaling a potential candle structure trading bearish
shadow reversal. However, an asset in oversold conditions could receive
a bullish reversal signal if a long lower shadow forms.

## Using Technical Indicators to Identify Potential Reversals in Price Movement

Technical indicators are mathematical formulas that use the price and
volume of an asset to calculate a value. Traders can use them to predict
future price movements based on their unique perspective on market data.
It is possible to identify potential reversals in price movement when
combined with candle shadow analysis.

Several technical indicators are accessible on the Quotex platform, such
as moving averages, relative strength indices (RSIs), moving average
convergence divergence (MACDs), and Bollinger Bands. There are a variety
of ways in which each of these indicators can give different insights
into market conditions. They can also complement candle shadow analysis
in several different ways.

Regarding momentum oscillators, the RSI measures how fast and how often
prices change. When the indicator oscillates between zero and one
hundred, it indicates an overbought or oversold condition. An RSI above
70 indicates an overbought asset, and an RSI below 30 indicates an
oversold asset.

With candle shadow trading, long upper shadows could indicate a
potential bearish reversal if the RSI exceeds 70. The asset may be due
for a price correction because the long upper shadow suggests buyers
cannot sustain the high prices.

RSIs below 30 indicate a potential bullish reversal when a long lower
shadow forms. In this case, the long lower shadow suggests that sellers
could not keep the price low, and the oversold conditions suggest that a
bounce in price may be looming.

## Bottom Line

A candlestick chart\'s shadow provides valuable insights into market
sentiment and price movement. It is important to understand the
different types of candle shadows --- such as upper shadows, lower
shadows, long upper and lower shadows, wide range candles, green and red
candles, and bullish engulfing patterns --- to help you improve your
trading strategies.

Combining this knowledge with technical indicators on the Quotex
platform can greatly increase your success in trading.
